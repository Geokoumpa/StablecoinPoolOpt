Start implementing the task with the provided task number from the or_tools_hybrid_model_implementation_plan.md file, based on the guidelines found in the context folder.  A task cannot be considered completed if there are errors in the codebase and if I haven't approved the solution. When the task is completed and tested, mark it as complete in the or_tools_hybrid_model_implementation_plan.md, git commit and do not proceed with implementing the next task.
