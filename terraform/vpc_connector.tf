# VPC Access Connector - DEPRECATED
# This file is kept for reference but the connector has been removed
# in favor of Direct VPC Egress for Cloud Run

# Note: The following resources have been removed:
# - google_vpc_access_connector.cloud_sql_connector
# - google_project_iam_member.cloud_run_vpc_access
# - output.vpc_connector_name
# - output.vpc_connector_id

# Direct VPC Egress is now configured directly in cloud_run.tf
