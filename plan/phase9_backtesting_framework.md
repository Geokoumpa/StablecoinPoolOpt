# Phase 7: Backtesting Framework

This phase focuses on developing a dedicated backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the asset allocation strategy against historical data.

## Detailed Tasks:

### 7.1 Develop the Backtesting Simulation Engine
- Create a Python script or module for the backtesting engine.
- The engine should be able to re-run the entire data pipeline and optimization logic for historical periods.
- It must apply configured parameters and rules as they would have existed on each historical day, utilizing historical snapshots from `allocation_parameters`.
- Ensure the engine can simulate historical portfolio state and transaction costs using `raw_etherscan_account_transactions` and `raw_etherscan_account_balances`.

### 7.2 Implement Performance Metric Calculation
- Develop functions to calculate key performance indicators from backtesting results:
    - Simulated daily and cumulative returns.
    - Drawdowns and volatility.
    - Sharpe ratio and other risk-adjusted returns.
    - Transaction costs incurred during rebalancing.
- Store these metrics in a dedicated backtesting results table (e.g., `backtesting_results`).

### 7.3 Develop Reporting and Visualization for Backtesting Results
- Create scripts or modules to generate detailed reports and visualizations of backtesting results.
- This could include:
    - Time-series plots of cumulative returns, drawdowns.
    - Histograms of daily returns.
    - Tables summarizing key performance metrics.
- Consider using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations.
- The framework should support systematic testing of different sets of allocation parameters to identify optimal configurations.
